# Ginny.readme
I want to help you understand how I am most easily motivated and communicated with, in my natural state. However, one of my defining features is my flexibility, so I adapt to almost any environment or group dynamic.
## About me
- I am predictable, consistent, and steady, bringing stability to my team
- I approach problems and conflicts with persistence and perseverance, aiming for my goals through patience and resolve
- I turn confrontation into positives
- I gather data for decision-making
- I love finding shortcuts that support quality
- I am a One on the Enneagram (“Reformer” or “Perfectionist”), wing Nine (“Peacemaker”)
- I am an INFJ—a very very introverted one
- I am a [highly sensitive person](https://www.fastcompany.com/90581287/5-reasons-highly-sensitive-people-are-an-asset-to-your-team), picking up on nuances and processing things deeply
- I have a very dry sense of humor
## Top motivators
### Traditional/Regulatory
- Extending and strengthening proven best practices and established structures
- Thoughtfully making changes based on knowledge of history and reasons why things are the way they are
- Creating unity and order
- Following principles
- Following proven, quality-oriented work models
- Honoring authority
- Doing things the right way; I would rather do one thing well than many things quickly. I don’t care about quick fixes, and resist them if I feel they are unsound
### Social
- Serving people and contributing to the progress and well-being of the team
- Completing tasks to meet others’ needs
- Cooperating with others, not competing with them
## Communication
- I like a friendly, open communication style
- I like to know what is expected of me in a working relationship, and have everyone’s responsibilities defined
- I enjoy relating to others with warmth and personal presence, winning them over
- I will only leverage my charisma if I feel very relaxed
- I become more objective when I’m challenged or stressed, feeling I can only make a case with logical facts
- I like written instructions
- I like to know what support is available when I am pressured for quick results
- I am deeply impacted by positive or negative verbal feedback
- I problem-solve through verbally processing in conversations (among other tactics)
- I best accept change with prior conditioning, and explanation of why it’s warranted

## Ideal work environment
- A small, quality-oriented team where I can develop a sense of belonging
- A wide variety of people I can develop long-standing personal relationships with
- A stable and predictable environment, with time to change and time to perform up to my high standards
- A manager who gives me personal attention
- A high percentage of planned projects or immediate routine tasks—and a lower percentage of unpredictable, urgent work

## Pitfalls
- Processing  _everything_ deeply, indiscriminately
- Being hesitant and overly cautious about change
- Taking a slow, methodical approach to problems rather than attacking them immediately, even to the point of biding my time when lacking clear urgency or social motivation
- Being reactive instead of proactive
- Avoiding conflict and confrontation
- Feeling overwhelmed by having many different projects on my plate at the same time
- Needing clearly defined priorities
- Being highly susceptible to the fragmenting effect of task-switching
- Avoiding accountability by overstating the complexity of the situation
- Not projecting a sense of urgency when I need help
- Depending on others for decisions, even if I know I’m right
- Lacking curiosity about theoretical knowledge, only focusing on things that seem immediately relevant
- Sensing how others are feeling and take it to heart, feeling stressed and distracted by it
- Saying yes to all requests for my time or abilities
